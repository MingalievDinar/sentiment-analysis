# sentiment-analysis

The project is to analyse of text tonality / sentiment analysis.

The aim - is to develop a model that will give accurate predictions for the customer's test sample, but the training sample for is not given. It should be collected.

The first step was to build a model with the given data about on films review. At this step, I learnt how to analyze the text, what metrics to use, how the classifiers and their settings are better able to cope with this task.
Then, the second step is sentiment analysis of product reviews in the store.
This task is divided into the following sub-tasks:
1. Data collection / parsing of a real online store
2. Data processing and cleaning
3. Model selection, cross-validation tests
4. Make an interactive demonstration for your algorithm
